 What Does This Tool Do?
The tool takes a list of Steam accounts (in user:pass format) and checks their validity and status, categorizing them based on the login outcome.

Key Features:
⚡ High Performance: Multi-threaded design for fast and intensive checking.
 Flexible Proxy Support: Load your proxy list from a file (ip:port or user:pass@ip:port) or use an external Proxy API (cracked.miami API is recommended for good proxies).
 Accurate Result Categorization: Sorts your accounts into:
 WORK: Successfully logged-in accounts.
BAD: Incorrect account credentials.
 2FA: Accounts requiring Mobile Authenticator (Steam Guard).
 MFA: Accounts requiring Email Authentication.
⚫ UNPROCESSED: Accounts whose status couldn't be definitively determined after retries (may be proxy issues or temporary).
 Automatic Result Saving: All results are automatically saved in a results folder, organized into subfolders by date and time of the check.
 User-Friendly GUI: A clean and intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter makes loading files and controlling the process easy.
⚙️ Advanced Handling: Automatically fetches the necessary RSA key and encrypts the password for the login process.
 Built-in Retry Mechanism: Attempts to re-check accounts that face transient failures using different proxies.
 "Get Free API" Button: Opens the Cracked.Miami API page directly from the tool.
